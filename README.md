## Project description

My project consists of my political group with questions for the public and they are allowed to 
vote on answers of the questions to their choices regarding the services recieved and lacking 
from our government so people are aware of change been made in the government to provide better services.
It has an event planned for the party where people are made aware of the party's aspected work to be done for them.
